# Bootstrap Portfolio

This is a general template that was built mixing several other codes found in [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).

## Technologies

HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JS (Just a little bit, irrelevant).

## Objective

Develop a portfolio template that looks cool but does not have much code.

## How the template was built

We are using the following external libraries:

1. Import imported the bootstrap css form a CDN:

> <link href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous">

Note: We dont need the javacript bootstrap part because we are not going to use it.

2. Import fix.js from the js folder because the file needs 2 small javascript scripts, you don;t need to understand those small fixes yet, don't worry about it:
3. The create all yout html base including a first version of all the body content.
4. Start adding the css styles based whatever you see that needs fixing.
5. Create the single-project html the same way you created this one (import bootstrap.css and fix.js in that file too)
6. On the project section of index.html add path to single-project.html into the href property of the anchors.
