*Deliver, deliver, deliver!*

From now on you are going to be treated as a developer and good developers are the ones that deliver. We are not going to give you stickers for effort, just like in real life your performance is based on productivity. Period.[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]

### What to do if you are stuck?

Clean the cache, try to use incognito window.
Look at google for solutions.
Talk to the other students.
Talk to senior developers you know.
Talk to the instructors over slack.

### What not to do if you are stuck?

Get frustrated and think you are not good for this: All the developers get stuck all the time, ask around! How do you know if you are good at something that you don't know? Coding is a science, facts matter and you have no facts.
Keep wondering around for hours without seeking help: Google is only as useful as you are good at googling, please speak to other students or your instructors.
Change strategy: Einstein once said, if you do the same stuff you will get the same results.
