# The Instagram Photo Feed

Congratulations! If you are about to start this project it means you already have enough knowledge to start doing interesting stuff.

*Deliver, deliver, deliver!*

From now on you are going to be treated as a developer and good developers are the ones that deliver. We are not going to give you stickers for effort, just like in real life your performance is based on productivity. Period.

## Instructions

Using everything you have learn with HTML and CSS3, please create a website that replicates [this exact picture](https://projects.breatheco.de/p/css/beginner/other/instagram-feed/example.png), your new website will have to look exactly as that picture.

You can use the display propery like in the old days or the new flex CSS property to make the feed of posts.

## Resources
