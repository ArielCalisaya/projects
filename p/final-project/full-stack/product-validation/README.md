Let's stop playing God here...

You had a great idea and your project its amazing, but now you want to add 
so many features that it's hard to know what to code first.

In the end, your project will be used by people, so.. Why not ask them what to do first?

## Instructions

1. Please create a survay to validate what stories to add into your MVP and what stories not to add.
> You can use [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/).
2. Please share that survay with a real life group of people very similar to your future users.
> Depending on your product it can be shared with Friends, Family, Social Media Followers, etc.
3. Gather the results and discuss the results with your teammates & teacher.
4. Based on the survey results, sort your used stories by priority.
