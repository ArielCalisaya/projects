## Resume
To this part of the project we like to call "Inception", not only because you're probably gonna have nightmares about this, but also because it's about building a profile inside your profile :D. It's something like PHP (find out what the first P in PHP stands for), but simpler ^^. And also, this is the *inception* of your job-seeking process, so try to enjoy it with confidence and positivism ;).

### Instructions
 1. Take all the sections of your Student External Profile, that you've already worked on, and pour them into a one-page long word document, using this layout: (link a pdf de Resume Guide)
 2. Save your word document as a pdf and name it "Resume [Name Last Name]"

### Resume Section
In this section, you will simply need to upload a pdf file with your resume. But first, you have to build your resume. Creating your resume is the first step to getting a job. 

Your resume must have the following sections, which you already have completed:
 1. Contact Information
 2. Summary Statement
 3. Skills
 4. Projects
 5. Experience & Education

Also may include:
 - Relevant Courses and Certifications
 - Volunteer Work
 - Awards
 - Personal Interests and Other Activities

### Keywords
An important consideration when building your resume is using job-specific keywords. Employers often search resume banks for special words or requirements specific to a job description. Including keywords in the summary, experience, skills and awards sections of your resume will increase your chances of being flagged as a potential match. You should also use such keywords in the title and brief description of yourself that most job sites request.

Keywords tend to be nouns that are industry-specific qualifications, skills or terms. Some keyword examples include degrees or certifications, job titles, computer lingo, industry jargon, product names, company names and professional organizations.
