> DATA MODELS DESCRIBE BUSINESS ENTITIES AND RELATIONSHIPS
>
> Data models are made up of entities, which are the objects or concepts we want to track data about, and they become the tables in a database. Products, vendors, and customers are all examples of potential entities in a data model. Entities have attributes, which are details we want to track about entitiesâ€”you can think of attributes as the columns in a table. If we have a product entity, the product name could be an attribute. [Source](https://www.credera.com/blog/technology-solutions/data-modeling-explained-in-10-minutes-or-less/)

One of the most important skills to develop in your coding career is to use [abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)) to translate from physical world to digital world.

Objects and Object Oriented programming are the best way to see this skill in action, we've seen this process happening when we represented cars in the digital world, not by their looks but by their data.

Just as almost all other subjects in coding/computer science there's a standard way to represent *data models*, it is called [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) (Unified Modeling Language). Check this video that explains how to create a [UML Diagram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI6lqHOVHic&list=PLUoebdZqEHTxNC7hWPPwLsBmWI0KEhZOd)

## Exercise

- Create a UML Diagram of the popular platform: **Instagram**. 
- Try to find 3 entities that represent the platform and are key for it to work. 
- Try to include at least 5 *attributes* per entity (some are invisible for the regular user, but not for a coder).
- Upload your diagram to a github repository and deliver the project when finished.
