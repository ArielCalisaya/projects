# TicTacToe With React.js

Time to start building cool stuff, let's code our first game! 

## Instructions

Create a tictactoe in React.js just like [this one](https://projects.breatheco.de/p/javascript/junior/games/tictactoe/). Remember to follow the recommended workflow to start coding:

1. Design your sitemap: How many pages/views?
2. Designing your wireframe: What components and where?
3. Start coding your components only rendering "Hello world" on earch of them (to make sure they work).
4. Create a list of all the possible user and system events that occure during runtime (for example: The user picks a player)
6. Create a javascript functions that will handle each of those evennts.
7. Console.log on each of those funtions to make sure they are being called.
8. Use the "status" object of each component to react to any changes, for example: You have to set the "current player" on the status, that way you can
render the current player on the screen and also show or hide the modal to choose a component (it should be hidden if this.status.currentPlayer != null)
9. Continue... whatch the video if you have any other doubts.

### Concepts you wil learn hard:

- Status of the components (global variables)
- Props
- Render method
- The function for checking the winner is a great learning algorithm
